# UFO Finder

This project aimed at creating a website that creates a table dynamically based on an array of JavaScript objects, and searches data to find rows that match user input.

## Resource:
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- VS Code

## Overview
In this project, we built a table that was displayed as a webpage using the data stored in the JavaScript array. We added a filter by date feature to make the page dynamic and to make it react to user input. Then using Bootcamp templates, we modified the entire page to include a stylistic presentation.

For our challenge, we added multiple filters, such as, city, state, country, and shape, in addition to the date filter already in place. It was more useful to have multiple conditions to filter from. 

## Results

### Search Criteria Procedure
**Index page**
This is the landing page. The user can re-initialize the page by clicking on the navbar at the top.

**Filtering by event date**
The user enters a date, the change is detected and the table is updated accordingly.

The user may also use ***all filters at once***.

## Summary

One drawback of this website presentation is the inability for the user to know exactly which filter are available for them to choose.There is sometimes a lot of trial and error to find some results, althought we have an extensive base of information. For example to pick a city, the user would have to go through the table and find the city desired for the analysis.

A way to remedy this would be to add a drop-down lists including all filter values in place of the input fields. Each list would need to update after a parameter is selected in any filter. We could also add a button to clear the filters after selection. The button would be located below the last filter.
